# woodlice-and-nursery-web-spiders
Data and analysis from three behavioral experiments examining how nursery web spiders and grasshoppers respond to the presence of woodlice.

The folder "Data" contains all the datasets used in the analysis and is loaded in largely during the assembly of data in the code "behaviour_March2019.R". 

Then, the data are analyzed using Bayesian models in STAN, which is accessed using the package "brms." 

The code automatically produces plots found in the paper along with other diagnostic plots.
